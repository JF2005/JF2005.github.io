  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>This is our second lesson of the year and since our last lesson was just getting everything back up and running again and preparing ourselves for the weeks ahead, this was really the first lesson on this new topic of Encryption.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Start using google sheets to encrypt code with a simple shift cipher</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes I did manage to complete the main task although along the way I did encounter a problem or two along the way. Overall I found the task not too challenging and most of the problem I encounters were because of little mistakes that didn't take too long to find and fix.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I had to use preserving a little bit as I did encounter a few small problems but not that much as they only took a bit of effort before they were solved.  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I didn't really use this skill. The only time I sort of used it was when I was questioning what I had done to find out if I had done something wrong and if so what.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I had to work independently on my own working on Google Sheets to make the functioning shift cipher for the main part of the lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>It is the same as for Questioning. The only time I used it was when looking back over my work to see if I made any errors and if so what errors.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I listened to what the teacher said when he was describing what we needed to do and a method of how we should be able to do it. Also I talked with people and gave them help when they needed it. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that the lesson could have gone better for my learning if I had paid a bit more attention to exactly what the teacher was saying so that when I got back to my computer I didn’t make small mistakes that meant that my spreadsheet wouldn’t work correctly. If I did this I would have prevented the small mistakes and so I would then have slightly more time to complete the work. Also I believe that I could have worked faster in my work and that if I did I would have had more time for my work.

To progress my learning a lot more, I think that as the other teacher was not able to teach his class (which are a lesson ahead) and so our teacher had to tell what the other class needed to do and how they would do it, I could have listened to what we are going to do in our next lesson and prepared myself for it in advance. This would allow me to get more out of my next lesson.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that next lesson I need to work faster on my work so that I manage to complete all of the available that I am able to do in time and can learn more and also I think that I need to pay a bit more attention to everything that the teacher is doing so that I don’t make the small mistakes that I did last time and so I have more time to do my work.</td>
