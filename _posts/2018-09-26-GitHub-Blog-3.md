  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>This is my third lesson into the term and for the last since the last lesson we have been expanding our abilities in and with spreadsheets. It turns out that in my last lesson I had done all of the work that we were supposed to be doing this lesson sdo for this lesson I would be starting ahead of everybody. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>The target for this lesson is to convert my skills from coding letters into other letters using a caesar cipher and then decoding the message into convert the letters into their corresponding ascii code and then decoding the message afterwards.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Not quite this lesson. I found it a bit difficult as I could do the first part of encoding the message easily yet it took a bit of time but then I couldn't think of a way to decode the new message. However now after thinking a bit at home I think that I have come up with a solution.</td>

<table class = "super-awesome-table">
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I had to use persevering a bit as at first I struggled to find the correct information that I wanted to use as I only wanted the binary form and so I had to preserve a little to find the correct information. Also I had to persevere to try and find a solution to my problem of decoding my encoded message. Sadly, as you know, I did not manage to find a solution to this problem in the lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I had to question my method of encoding my message and think whether there is a better way to encoded so that it is easier to decode afterwards.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>As no one else had got to the point at which I was at I had to work independently on this challenge of mine.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>After the lesson I had to reflect upon my work and the possible solutions that I had thought of but didn't really work so that I could think of a solution which will most probably work with a few adjustments.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I had to engage with other people when they asked me questions about how they would do the work that they were doing and I helped them a bit so that they didn’t get so stuck that they weren’t learning anything.</td>
  </tr>

<table class = "main-table">    
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that in this lesson I didn’t spend enough time continuously fully focusing on the work at hand as sometimes I would be interrupted by someone else who would ask me a question about the work they had to do or I would be having a conversation with the person next to me about something that wouldn’t be helping me on my work. I think that this meant that I didn’t have the capability to properly reflect on my work and find an answer as I was to preoccupied and wasn’t focused continuously for enough time. If I had stayed focused on my work  and the problem I had encountered I could have found the solution before the lesson had finished.</td>
  </tr>  
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>So, next time I think that I need to try and stay focused on my work continuously without interruption for longer amounts of time as I think that if I do this I will actually have the time to properly reflect on and think about my work and this will allow me to do better quality and more work within the time limits of the lesson. </td>
