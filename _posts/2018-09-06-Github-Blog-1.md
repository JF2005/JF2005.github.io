  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>This is my first lesson of Year 9 and so I was at the very start with a lot of work ahead of me. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>The easy target is to completely delete my Github account and all of the work I put into it (yet again) and start afresh. Then start rebuild my Github page again. However the more difficult and challenging target was to code something new and interesting into my website to improve its quality.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td> I did manage to reach the first and more simple target for the lesson and it wasn't too hard as everything I had done had been done by me previously and so I knew I could do it again. The only challenge was trying with this challenge was remembering it all! However in the lesson I did not manage to code something new into my website and stretch my knowledge mainly because of the time limits but I am sure I will be able to next time. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I did not really use this learning habit much as I didn't really encounter many problems this lesson but I am sure that I will be using this learning habit a lot later on.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Yet again I did not use this skill much but it is very likely that I will be asking questions about how to use google fonts and things like that before my next lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I used this learning habit quite a bit as for the last part of the lesson where we got to work on our resetted Github websites I needed to work on my own and be independent as we were each doing our own work on our own websites. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I used this learning habit when I needed to reflect upon what I had done last year and what code I added to help improve my website</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I did use this learning habit when I was engaged in conversation with my fellow students when we asked each other questions about how to code something.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that my working could have gone better if I had been a it more concentrated upon my work and what I was doing as I think that I did spend a bit too much time helping other people and talking with them. This meant that I was distracted from my work and couldnâ€™t put my full attention towards it and that meant that my work could have been better as I might have worked quicker than I did and had been able to get more done. Also I feel that my work could have been more planned out and structured which would have meant that I would always know what I was doing and what I should do next and would mean that I would have worked more logically and effectively.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>So next time I need to stay more focussed upon my work and concentrate upon it as much as I can as to maximise my learning. Of course I am not suggesting that I will completely ignore everybody around even when they are asking for assistance but instead trying to avoid me not doing work for a reason unrelated to what I was doing such as talking about something not to do with coding or school at all. Also next lesson I am going to try to be more structured in my working and in what I was doing and think about the whole lesson plan before I start working.</td>
