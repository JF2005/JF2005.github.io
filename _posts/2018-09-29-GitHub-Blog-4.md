  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>This is my fourth lesson of this half term on the topic of encryption. Last lesson I was working on coding letters into their corresponding ascii code and then decoding the encoded ascii message back into the correct text. This lesson I was continuing with this same task however last time I ran into a problem which I didn't know how to solve.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>My target for this lesson is to solve the problem from last lesson which I could not find an answer to last time and finally complete the task of decoding an encoded ascii message.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, I just about managed to complete my main objective in the time limits of the lesson. This was mainly achievable because in the period between last week’s lesson and this week’s lesson I had managed to think up of part of a solution that would help me massively in the lesson although I would to solve some problems created by it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I had to try and persevere when I encounter a problem instead of giving up, deleting all of my work and starting again as that would get me nowhere whereas if I persevere I would eventually reach my solution.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning</td>
    <td>I had to question my methods and thinkings when I encountered a problem as to help me try and see what went wrong or how to overcome the problem.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I had to spend the majority of the lesson working independently as I was at a different stage to the people working next to me and also as I was trying to stay focussed on my work.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I had to try and reflect upon last lesson's work so that I could see what the problem was so that I could start to build up a solution for the problem.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I had to listen to what my teacher told the class so that I completely understood and knew what I was doing. Also, I had to engage in conversation with my fellow pupils when either they asked me a question about the work or when I wanted to ask them a question.

  <tr>
    <td>I think that my lesson could have gone better if I had at times tried to 'take a step back’  and really look at all of my work fully and when I say all of my work I mean from all of the stuff I had just done to all the things I had done in the first cryptography lesson. I believe that if I had done that I would have been able to see some of the mistakes I had made along the way a lot quicker but also I believe it would help me find the solution to my problems faster. If I had done this and it had had the effect that I said it would have had this would mean that I would have had more time in the lesson to do more work and learn more and also I believe that it would help deepen my understanding of how to use spreadsheets and my capabilities on it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>So, next lesson I believe that I will need to try and ‘take a step back’ to help see the whole picture more as to try and find if I had found a way around a certain problem in an earlier lesson even if it was without realising and if so how I had done it. Also next lesson I think that I need to try and reflect more upon my work as I believe that it will help consolidate and deepen my understanding of our current topic.</td>
